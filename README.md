myMatrix.h

This headerfile contains a templated class called 'myMatrix' which defines 2D matrix for numeric types such as int, float, double and complex. A class called 'complex' is also defined. The operations defined in this file are addition(+,+=) and multiplication(&ast,&ast=) using expression templates. 

main.cpp 

main.cpp is a c++ file that tests the operations of myMatrix.h . The computational speeds of each example are also calculated here.
